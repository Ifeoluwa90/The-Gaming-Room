# Draw It or Lose It - Software Design Document

## Project Overview

This repository contains the software design document for Draw It or Lose It, a multi-platform game application developed for The Gaming Room. 

### Client Summary

The Gaming Room, our client, is a game development company looking to expand their Android-based game "Draw It or Lose It" into a web-based, multi-platform application. The game is inspired by the classic TV show "Win, Lose or Draw," where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. In this digital version, the application renders stock images as clues, with teams racing against time to guess the puzzle.

### Key Software Requirements

- Support for multiple teams and players in a single game instance
- Cross-platform compatibility (web-based, supporting various devices)
- Ability to render images from a large library of stock drawings
- Four rounds of play, each lasting one minute
- Unique identifiers for games, teams, and players
- Ensure only one instance of the game exists in memory at any time

## Reflection

### Strengths in Documentation

In developing this documentation, I believe I excelled in providing a comprehensive system architecture view. The detailed breakdown of the domain model, including the UML class diagram and explanations of class relationships, offers a clear blueprint for the development team. Additionally, the evaluation of different operating platforms for both server-side and client-side development demonstrates a thorough consideration of the project's technical requirements.

### Helpful Aspects of the Design Document Process

Working through the design document was instrumental in clarifying the project's scope and technical challenges. The process of detailing the requirements and constraints forced a deeper consideration of potential issues and solutions. This foresight proved invaluable when developing the code, as it provided a clear roadmap and helped anticipate and mitigate potential roadblocks.

### Areas for Improvement

If I could revise one part of this document, I would enhance the section on distributed systems and networks. While the current recommendations are solid, I believe there's room for a more detailed exploration of how to optimize real-time gameplay across different platforms and geographical locations. I would include more specific strategies for reducing latency and ensuring consistent gameplay experiences.

### Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

To interpret and implement the user's needs, I focused on the core gameplay experience described by The Gaming Room. This involved designing a system that could handle real-time image rendering, multi-player interactions, and cross-platform accessibility. Considering the user's needs is crucial in software design as it ensures the final product is not only functional but also engaging and user-friendly. In this case, smooth gameplay and consistent performance across different devices were paramount.

### Design Approach and Future Strategies

My approach to designing this software involved:

1. Thoroughly analyzing the client's requirements
2. Researching best practices for multi-platform game development
3. Creating a flexible, scalable architecture
4. Prioritizing user experience and performance

In future similar projects, I would employ these strategies along with:

- More extensive prototyping in the early stages
- Increased focus on scalability from the outset
- Earlier consideration of analytics and telemetry for post-launch improvements
- More robust security planning, especially for multi-player online games

This project has reinforced the importance of comprehensive planning and the value of a well-structured design document in guiding successful software development.
